Chatbot using NLP - AICTE Cycle-4

📌 Project Overview

This project is a Chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP), developed as part of the AICTE Internship Cycle-4. The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to user queries intelligently, leveraging machine learning techniques and NLP models.

🚀 Features

Intent Recognition: Uses NLP to understand user intent and provide relevant responses.

Pre-trained Models: Implements pre-trained NLP models for improved accuracy.

Tokenization & Text Preprocessing: Cleans and processes user input for better understanding.

Customizable Responses: Easily modifiable responses based on use cases.

Interactive User Interface: Engaging UI for seamless communication.

🏗️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

NLP Libraries: NLTK, spaCy

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

Web Framework: Flask (if applicable)

Dataset: Custom-built or open-source dataset for training

🔧 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the chatbot:

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Priya-anandhan/Chatbot_using_NLP_AICTE_Cycle-4.git
cd Chatbot_using_NLP_AICTE_Cycle-4

Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Chatbot

python chatbot.py

Interact with the Chatbot

Type your queries in the terminal or via the web interface (if available).

📊 Dataset & Model Training

The chatbot uses a dataset of predefined intents and responses.

Text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization are applied.

The model is trained using classification algorithms to map inputs to appropriate responses.

🎯 Project Goals

Develop an AI-driven chatbot that can effectively communicate with users.

Implement NLP techniques for improved understanding and response generation.

Ensure the chatbot is scalable and adaptable for various applications.
